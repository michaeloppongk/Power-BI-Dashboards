# Power-BI-Dashboards

**Project Description: Sales Transaction Analysis Dashboard for an Electronics Company**

This project involves the creation of an interactive and data-driven dashboard in Power BI, designed to analyze sales transactions for an electronics company over a one-year period, from September 2023 to September 2024. The dataset includes detailed customer demographics, product information, purchase behaviors, and sales performance metrics.

### **Key Objectives:**
1. **Sales Performance Tracking**: Monitor sales trends over time, including total sales revenue, product performance, and customer segmentation.
2. **Customer Demographics Analysis**: Analyze the distribution of customers by age, gender, and loyalty membership, and their correlation to purchase behavior and product preferences.
3. **Product Type Insights**: Track the performance of different product types, including smartphones, laptops, tablets, and smartwatches, to identify high-selling items and potential areas of improvement.
4. **Order and Payment Behavior**: Examine order status trends, payment methods, and average transaction values, along with cancellations and completions, to gain insights into customer preferences and potential issues.
5. **Shipping and Add-on Purchases**: Evaluate customer choices in shipping types (e.g., Standard, Overnight) and analyze how frequently add-ons (e.g., accessories, extended warranties) are purchased and their impact on overall revenue.

### **Dashboard Features:**
- **Sales Overview**: Visual representation of total revenue, units sold, and top-performing product categories on a monthly and quarterly basis. Key KPIs such as average total price, average rating, and order completion rates are highlighted.
- **Customer Analysis**: Interactive visuals showing customer demographics such as age distribution, gender splits, and loyalty membership trends over time. Visuals allow slicing data by product type and customer loyalty status to understand engagement and retention.
- **Product Performance**: A detailed breakdown of sales performance for each product category (Smartphones, Laptops, Tablets, and Smartwatches) with customer ratings and product SKU trends, helping identify the best and worst-performing products.
- **Payment and Order Status**: Analysis of payment methods (Cash, Credit Card, Paypal) and order statuses (Completed, Cancelled) with insights into the relationship between payment method choice and order fulfillment outcomes.
- **Shipping and Add-ons**: Insights into customer preferences for shipping types (Standard, Express, Overnight) and an analysis of how add-ons (e.g., warranties, accessories) contribute to overall revenue.

### **Data Sources:**
- **Customer ID**: Unique identification used for tracking purchase behavior.
- **Purchase Date**: Transaction dates used for monthly, quarterly, and seasonal analysis.
- **Total Price, Unit Price, Quantity**: Key sales metrics to calculate total revenue, average transaction values, and profit margins.
- **Ratings and Feedback**: Customer-provided ratings (1-5 stars) used to assess product satisfaction.
- **Add-ons and Shipping**: Additional revenue from add-ons and customer choices for shipping preferences.

### **Technologies Used**:
- **Power BI**: For creating the interactive dashboard, visualizations, and report generation.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: Used for creating custom measures, KPIs, and calculating sales metrics such as average order value, customer lifetime value, and churn rates.
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: Ensuring data accuracy and consistency across all customer orders and transactions, particularly handling data related to loyalty members and cancellations.

### **Impact:**
The dashboard enables stakeholders to:
- **Make Data-Driven Decisions**: With insights into product performance, customer behavior, and payment trends, stakeholders can optimize marketing strategies, improve product offerings, and enhance the customer experience.
- **Understand Customer Behavior**: Gain a deeper understanding of customer demographics and purchasing habits, enabling more targeted marketing efforts and loyalty programs.
- **Track Business Performance**: Easily monitor sales growth, identify bottlenecks in order fulfillment, and track the success of different payment methods and add-on offerings.

This project serves as a comprehensive tool for analyzing sales and customer data, providing actionable insights to drive business growth and enhance operational efficiency within the electronics industry.
